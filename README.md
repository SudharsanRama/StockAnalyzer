# stock-analyzer
A simple web app for trying out Pandas data framework built with Flask for REST services and jQuery UI.

Uses simple linear regression algorithm to predict the closing values of stocks for a period of last 6 months and displays the correctness with the help of RMSE (Root-mean-squared-error) metric. The model is trained with the relationship between average(high, low) to the closing values for first 18 months.
